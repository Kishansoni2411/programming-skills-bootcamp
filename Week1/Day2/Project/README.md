# Day2 - Project

 This project involves creating a simple login system in either Java or Python, using basic variables, datatypes, and control flow statements.

 Store an email and password in respective variables, compare them to a set of predefined email and password values(suppose that the second values are provided by user), and then either grant access or deny it based on whether or not the input values match

## Suggestions

```java
String email="demo@email.com";
String password="123";
String userEmail="demo1@email.com";
String userPassword="234";
```

## Pseudocode

1. store an email (consider this email as pre stored value)
2. store a password(consider this password as pre stored value)
3. store an second email(consider this email as user entered/provided email for Login)
4. match both emails
5. check if both emails match then goto step 6 else goto step 7
6. check if both passwords match then print success and goto step 8 else goto step 7
7. print wrong credentials
8. Exit Program
