# Login System Project

## Project Description

In this project, we will create a login system using classes and objects. The program will store a pre-defined email and password, and ask the user to enter their email and password. If the email and password match the pre-defined values, the program will print "Login Successful". If the email and password do not match, the program will print "Wrong Credentials". The program will then exit.
Project Instructions

>Follow the instructions below to create the login system:

1. Create a class named **_LoginSystem_**.
2. Inside the class, define two private fields named **_email_** and **_password_** to store the pre-defined email and password.
3. Define a method named **_setCredentials_** that initializes data members: **_email_** and **_password_**. The method should initialize the fields with the provided values.
4. Define a method named **_login_** that takes two values from user: **_userEmail_** and **_usrePassword_**. The method should compare the provided email and password with the pre-defined values. If they match, print "Login Successful". Otherwise, print "Wrong Credentials".
5. Define a **_main_** method that creates an object of the **_LoginSystem_**. Now, call **_setCredentials_** to set values, Then call the **_login_** method with the provided values.
